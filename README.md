# **Analyzing the Impact of Financial Satisfaction on Happiness**

## **Overview**
This project explores the relationship between financial satisfaction and happiness among Moroccan households. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, the study provides insights into how financial well-being influences feelings of happiness. The dataset and analysis methods aim to uncover trends and patterns, as well as highlight regional differences in this relationship.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains survey data collected from Moroccan households, including:
- **Happiness Levels** (`Feeling of happiness (LV_Q46)`): Ranked from *Not at all happy* to *Very happy*.
- **Financial Satisfaction** (`Satisfaction with financial situation of household (NV_Q50)`): Levels of satisfaction with household financial situations.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and map categorical variables to meaningful labels.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze and visualize the distribution of happiness and financial satisfaction.
3. **Statistical Modeling**:
   - Use ordinal regression to quantify the impact of financial satisfaction on happiness.
4. **Regional Analysis**:
   - Create choropleth maps to highlight regional differences using GeoPandas and Plotly.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Generate violin plots, scatter plots, and interactive maps to present findings.

## **Results**
- **Correlation**:
  Financial satisfaction has a positive correlation with happiness (e.g., higher financial satisfaction generally aligns with higher happiness levels).
  
- **Regional Differences**:
  The relationship between financial satisfaction and happiness varies by region, influenced by factors like economic opportunities and infrastructure.

## **Visualizations**
1. **Violin Plot**:
   - Displays the distribution of financial satisfaction across happiness levels.
2. **Choropleth Map**:
   - Highlights regional variations in the relationship between financial satisfaction and happiness.

## **Conclusion**
The study demonstrates that financial satisfaction is an important factor influencing happiness, but its impact varies by region. These findings emphasize the need to consider local contexts in policy-making and socio-economic planning.
